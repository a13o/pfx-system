Still a WIP.

Check out demo.js for an example of how to use the lib.

pfx-system.js is meant to be the lib's internals and will be distributed from this repo.

The example configs in src/config show what a third party effect would look like. They can be distributed separately from the pfx-system, creating a plugin ecosystem.
